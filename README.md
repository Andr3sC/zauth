# zauth
Yad wrapper for oathtool

Encrypt your OTP seed files with gpg and place them in a directory on your computer.

Adjust the `DIR_KEYS` variable on the script, and viola, **zauth** using **yad** will present the files, and using again **yad** plus **oauth** and **gpg** a text entry window with the OTP will be presented.
